Problem: What problem does your program solve?	
This program would accomplish a few things. It is a framework for finding long term exercise partners as well as quick get-togethers for sports or e-sports. In the gym, I often see people doing an exercise by themselves while others wait to then do the exact same thing. With this app, lifters and general fitness buffs would find partners to exercise with, be it temporary or long term, which would alleviate busy facilities and generally provide for safer heavy lifting practices.
